With this blog I intend to apply the principle of learning in public and follow the advice of Rachel Thomas in Why you (yes, you) should blog. This goes against my inclination as I typically am not one to share my work in public. However this is my attempt at changing that. What you will find on my blog are my notes and project work for the fast.ai course. .",
