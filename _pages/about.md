# Introduction

Hi, my name is Kemal.

# Machine Learning

I am interested in learning Machine Learning. I have decided to follow the course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) by [Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/#your-teacher). With this blog I intend to apply the principle of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). This goes against my inclination as I am not one to share my work typically. However this is my attempt at changing that. What you will find on my blog are my notes and project work for the fast.ai course.

# Reading

Besides being about my Machine Learning learning journey, this blog will also contain posts on the books I read. In the past I used to read quite a bit for leisure. However in recent years I unfortunately stopped doing this. I would like to pick it up again by [reading at least 5 books per month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRBkIdc_VYU). Each month I will read a mixture of books:

- Educational as well as for leisure
- Different languages (English, Dutch, Turkish)

After having read a book I will write a blog post about it and reflect on what I read.
