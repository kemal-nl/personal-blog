    "- McCulloch, Pitts realized that simplified model of a real neuron could be represented using simple addition and thresholding. Further reading: _A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, McCulloch, Pitts_.\n",
    "- Rosenblatt further built on this work to develop a machine that could learn (Mark I Perceptron). Further reading: _The Design of an Intelligent Automaton, Rosenblatt_.\n",
    "- Minsky and Papert states about Rosenblatt's invention that a single layer of these devices was unable to learn some simple but crtical mathematical function such as XOR. They also showed that with multiple layers these limitations could be addressed. Only first insight was widely recognized and neural networks were abandoned for two decades because of this misperception. Further reading: _Perceptrons_\n",
    "- Pivotal work in neural networks by Rumelhart, McClellan. In their book _Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP)_, they propose that PDP requires:\n",
    "    1. A set of _processing units_\n",
    "    1. A state of _activation_\n",
    "    1. An _output function_ for each unit\n",
    "    1. A _pattern of connectivity_ among units\n",
    "    1. A _propagation rule_ for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities\n",
    "    1. An _activation rule_ for combining inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit\n",
    "    1. A _learning rule_ whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience\n",
    "    1. An _environment_ within which the system must operate\n",
    "- Although a second layer can approximate all functions, this results in a slow neural network. In more recent work, more layers of neurons are being used, as a consequence of which performance and speed has improved and neural networks are living up to their potential."
